       "[Document(page_content='BUILDING SOILS FOR BETTER CROPS: ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT FOR HEALTHY SOILS3\\nChapter 1\\nHEALTHY SOILS\\nAll over the country [some soils are] worn out, depleted, exhausted, almost dead.  \\nBut here is comfort: These soils possess possibilities and may be restored to high  \\nproductive power, provided you do a few simple things. \\n—C.W. BURKETT, 1907 \\nIt should come as no surprise that many cultures \\nhave considered soil central to their lives. After all, peo-\\nple were aware that the food they ate grew from the soil. Our ancestors who first practiced agriculture must have been amazed to see life reborn each year when seeds placed in the ground germinated and then grew to matu -\\nrity. In the Hebrew Bible, the name given to the first man,\\n Adam, is the masculine version of the word “earth” \\nor “soil” (adama). The name for the first woman, Eve (or Hava in Hebrew), comes from the word for “living.” Soil and human life were considered to be intertwined. A particular reverence for the soil has been an import -\\nant part of the cultures of many civilizations, including Native American tribes. In reality,\\n soil is the basis of all \\nterrestrial life. We humans are derived from soil. Aside from when we eat fish and other aquatic organisms, we obtain the essential elements in our bodies, such as the calcium and phosphorus in our bones and teeth, the nitrogen in our proteins, the iron in our red blood cells, and so on, all by directly or indirectly consuming plants that took these from the soil.\\nAlthough we focus on the critical role soils play in \\ngrowing crops, it’s important to keep in mind that soils also provide other important services. Soils govern whether rainfall runs off the field or enters the ground and eventually helps recharge underground aquifers.  \\nWhen a soil is stripped of vegetation and starts to degrade,\\n excessive runoff and flooding are more com -\\nmon. Soils also absorb, release and transform many different chemical compounds. For example,\\n they help \\nto purify wastes flowing from the septic system drain fields in your backyard. Soils also provide habitats for a diverse group of organisms, many of which are very important, such as those bacteria that produce antibiot -\\nics and fungi that help plants obtain nutrients and water and improve soil structure.\\n Soil organic matter stores \\na huge amount of atmospheric carbon. Carbon, in the form of carbon dioxide, is a greenhouse gas associated \\nPhoto by Dan Anderson', metadata={'source': 'Documents/two_chapters.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='BUILDING SOILS FOR BETTER CROPS: ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT FOR HEALTHY SOILS4\\nCHAPTER 1 HEALTHY SOILSwith global warming. So, by increasing soil organic \\nmatter, more carbon can be stored in soils, reducing the potential for climate change. We also use soils as a foun -\\ndation for roads, industry and our communities. \\nHOW IS SOIL MADE?\\nBefore we consider what makes a soil rich or poor, we should learn how it comes into existence. Soil consists of four parts: solid mineral particles, water, air and organic matter. The particles are generally of sand, silt and clay size (and sometimes also larger fragments) and were derived from weathering of rocks or deposition of sediments. They mainly consist of silicon, oxygen, aluminum, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium and other minor chemical elements. But these elements are generally locked up in the crystalline particles and are not directly available to plants. However, unlike solid rock, soil particles have pore spaces in between them that allow them to hold water through capillary action: the soil can act like a sponge. This is an important process because it allows the soil water, with the help of carbon dioxide in the air, to very slowly dissolve the mineral particles and release nutrients—we call this chemical weathering. The soil water and dissolved nutrients, together referred to as the soil solution, are now available for plants. The air in the soil, which is in contact with the air above ground, provides roots with oxygen and helps remove excess carbon dioxide from respiring root cells. \\nWhat role do plants and soil organisms play? They  \\nfacilitate the cycling of organic matter and of the nutri-ents,\\n which allows soil to continue supporting life. \\nPlants’ leaves capture solar energy and atmospheric carbon from carbon dioxide (CO\\n2) through photosyn-\\nthesis. The plant uses this carbon to build the sugars, starches and all the other organic chemicals it needs to live and reproduce. At the same time,\\n plant roots absorb \\nboth soil water and the dissolved nutrients (nitrogen is added to soils or directly to plants through associated biological processes). Now, the mineral nutrients that were derived from the soil are stored in the plant bio -\\nmass in organic form in combination with the carbon from the atmosphere\\n. The seeds tend to be especially \\nhigh in nutrients, but the stems and leaves also contain important elements. Eventually plants die and their leaves and stems return to the soil surface. Sometimes plants don’t return directly to the soil surface, but rather are eaten by animals. These animals extract nutrients and energy for themselves and then defecate what remains. Soil organisms help to incorporate both manure and plant residues into the soil, while the roots that die, of course, are already in the soil. This dead plant material and manure become a feast for a wide variety of organisms—beetles, spiders, worms, fungi, bacteria, etc.—that in turn benefit from the energy and nutrients the plants had previously stored in their biomass. At the same time, the decomposition of organic material makes nutrients available again to plants, now completing the cycle. \\nBut is it a perfect cycle? Not quite, because it has not \\nevolved to function under intensive agricultural produc -\\ntion. The chemical weathering process that adds new nutrients into the cycle continues at a very slow pace.', metadata={'source': 'Documents/two_chapters.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='evolved to function under intensive agricultural produc -\\ntion. The chemical weathering process that adds new nutrients into the cycle continues at a very slow pace.\\n \\nOn the other end of the cycle the soil captures some of the organic matter and puts it “in storage.” This happens because soil mineral particles, especially clays, form bonds with the organic molecules and thereby protect them from further decomposition by soil organisms. In addition, organic matter particles inside soil aggregates are protected from decomposition. Over a long time, the soil builds up a considerable reservoir of nutrients from slowly decomposing minerals and carbon, and of energy from plant residue in the form of organic matter—similar to putting a small amount of money into a retirement account each month. This organic matter storage system is especially impressive with prairie and steppe soils in temperate regions (places like the central United States, Argentina and Ukraine) because natural', metadata={'source': 'Documents/two_chapters.pdf', 'page': 1})]"
